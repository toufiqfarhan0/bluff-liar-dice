/**
 * PHASE 9 - the whole game, live on devnet.
 *
 * Four players, real stakes, a real TEE rollup and the real VRF oracle. Every
 * claim the pitch makes has to be visible in this transcript or it is not true:
 *
 *   - answers are unreadable while a round is open, to everyone;
 *   - who has answered is visible, which is the tension;
 *   - the rule is drawn after the answers are locked;
 *   - the pot pays out on Solana from a vault the rollup never touched.
 *
 * Run:  bun run game.ts
