/**
 * Driving an abandoned public room to its end.
 *
 * Nobody owns a dealt room, so nobody is obliged to finish one. Six people
 * could be seated and all six close the app, and their stakes would sit in a
 * vault behind a game that never ends.
 *
 * They do not, because closing a round is permissionless once its window has
 * passed and a room can only survive twelve of them. Anyone at all can walk a
 * dead room to the end, and settle then pays whoever the rules left standing.
 * This is that walk.
